MPI &amp; OpenMPI Learning
Machine learning 

The MPI was first used when I wrote the program by Fortran to compute the heatflux of low-dimensional systems.   
But I just learned a little about MPI, and I decided to learn it more intensively now.

Targets : Computer Architecture, MPI, OpenMP and so on.
